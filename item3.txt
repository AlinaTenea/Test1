V-model: 
-is a sequential model 
-a stage can begin only after the previous stage was fully completed
-introduce the principle of early testing
-introduce the test levels 
-activities of development and testing can overlap sometimes
-the defects can be detected early
-is recommended for small projects when the requirements should be clear and well-known
-if changes are required at the midleware, the all the documents need to be updated, for testing and for development
Agile: 
- is a incremental/iterative model 
- suppose that the system is divided into some small pieces
- each piece need to pass through the development stages: requirements analysis, design, building/code, testing and maintainance
- the principles of agile: adaptability, flexibility, collaboration
- the initial delivery cost is low
- is flexible 
- the time for product delivery is short 
- the planning and design of the system should be very clear and well defined before divide the system in pieces
- the testing activities are done through each phase for the each piece of the software
- the features grow incrementally, are added from a release to another
